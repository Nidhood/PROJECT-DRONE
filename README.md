# DRONE-PROJECT: Transforming Dreams into Reality with ROS and Gazebo üöÄ‚ú®

Welcome to an exhilarating journey into the realm of robotics, where dreams take flight and innovation knows no bounds. In this project, we have harnessed the power of ROS Noetic and Gazebo 11 to create a cutting-edge drone experience that goes beyond the ordinary.

## About the Project

Our project revolves around a meticulously crafted drone simulation, leveraging the robust capabilities of ROS Noetic for seamless communication and coordination. Gazebo 11, our playground of possibilities, breathes life into our virtual environment, providing a dynamic and realistic arena for our drone to soar.

## Key Features
- **State-of-the-Art Simulation:** Immerse yourself in a state-of-the-art drone simulation, meticulously designed to replicate real-world scenarios. Gazebo's advanced physics engine ensures an authentic experience, allowing you to push the boundaries of your drone's capabilities.

- **Intuitive ROS Control:** Harness the power of ROS Noetic for intuitive control and communication. Our project seamlessly integrates ROS functionalities, empowering you to interact with your drone effortlessly and make your wildest ideas take flight.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Nidhood/PROJECT-DRONE.git
   ```

2. **Enter the Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   cd ~/PROJECT-DRONE
   ```

3. **Build the Docker:**
   Make sure you have Docker installed. Then, run the following command to build and run the container:
   ```sh
   source run_image.sh
   ```

   This script likely defines and runs a Docker container with the necessary configurations for your project.

4. **Inside the Container:**
   After running the container, you can build and load dependencies with the following command:
   ```sh
   source init.sh
   ```

   This will likely install all the dependencies necessary for your project.

5. **Start the Simulation in Gazebo:**
   To run the simulation in Gazebo, use the following command:
   ```sh
   roslaunch hector_quadrotor_gazebo quadrotor_empty_world.launch
   ```

6. **Use ROS Control:**
   To control the drone using ROS teleop, run the following command:
   ```sh
   rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
   ```

   This command will likely allow you to send movement commands to the drone using the keyboard.
